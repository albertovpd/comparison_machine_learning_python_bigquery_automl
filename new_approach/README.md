# Pros and cons of the different Google tools for Machine Learning.
 
In this repo you will find a regression and classification comparison between:

- Google BigQuery
- Python (with Google Colab)
- Google AutoML

        In addition to the final scores, in /src are available the files to create the models with the mentioned tools. 


We will be working with a public Martech dataset, strongly related to my field of work. Let's see if we can overcome the BigQuery and AutoML metrics manually ;)

# TO DO

- bigquery, follow thiw: https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/bqml-intro/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0

- python regression
- automl regression

- bigquery transform the regression problem in classification (there will be overfitting??)
- automl classification (wtf i do here to avoid overfitting)
- python classification (turn it into a classification problem is easy but i'll need to balance the dataset, etc etc. check the saved articles out)
