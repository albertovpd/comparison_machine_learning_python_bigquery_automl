# Pros and cons of the different Google tools for Machine Learning.
 
In this repo you will find a regression and classification comparison between:

- Google BigQuery
- Python (with Google Colab)
- Google AutoML

        In addition to the final scores, in /src are available the files to create the models with the mentioned tools. 


We will be working with a public Martech dataset, strongly related to my field of work. Let's see if we can overcome the BigQuery and AutoML metrics manually ;)
